## my personal dotfiles

backing up my dotfiles on github

### todo

* add in all dotfiles that i need
* keep install script updated with new dofiles and directories
* add homebrew packages for programs i installed without homebrew
* use brewfile to automate homebrew packages install
    * use `brew bundle` to install everything from brewfile
    * use `brew bundle dump -f` to update existing brewfile
    * side note: `brew update && brew upgrade` is used to first sync local repo with remotes and then brew upgrade changes install software to match updated local repos 
* find ways to save/autoinstall programs installed with other package managers (ruby gems, rust crates, etc)
