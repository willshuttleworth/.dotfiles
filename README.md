## my personal dotfiles

backing up my dotfiles on github

### usage

1. install xcode cli: `xcode-select --install`
2. `git clone https://github.com/willshuttleworth/.dotfiles ~`
3. run installation script to install homebrew and its packages 

### todo

* add in all dotfiles that i need
* keep install script updated with new dofiles and directories
* find ways to save/autoinstall programs installed with other package managers (ruby gems, rust crates, etc)
